# Grid-practice

## Details
- I coding along with Net Ninja's Responsive Grid Design course. This course really helped me to gain a deeper understanding of CSS Grid and Media Queries. I was then able to apply the concepts I learned here in my Portfolio MVP project as well as in the final Four Week project at School of Code.
