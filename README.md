# Grid-practice

## Details
- I coding along with Net Ninja's Responsive Grid Design course. This course really helped me to gain a deeper understanding of CSS Grid and Media Queries. I was then able to apply the concepts I learned here in my <a href='https://github.com/KieranWebDev/Portfolio-MVP'> Portfolio MVP</a> project as well as in the <a href="https://github.com/SchoolOfCode/final-project_front-end-untrodden">final Four Week project</a> at School of Code.
